int main(int argc, char const* argv[]) {
    printf("Working with Percentages\n");

    /*
        Percent
        -> In latin "centum" means "one hundred" (100).
        -> Per cent - Per 100
        -> Per = out of
        -> Cent = a hundred
        -> = Out of a hundred

        Percents convey magnitude by comparing to 100.
        And returning a value as a fraction of a hundred.

        If you get 90% in a maths test, you could have gotten 9/10, 18/20, 450/500, or any other number obeys this ration.

        Whatever we have the larger number, we convert it in 100 by multiply by 10.
        We do this both sides.
        Like 9/10 multiply by 10 = 90/100

        Percentages are ratios (___ out of 100).
        100 is totally arbitrary. It is the ideal size of comparison.
        100 is small enough that it is easy to comprehend its magnitude.
        And large enough that we can make meaningful comparisons between 0 and 100.

        We can simplify them.
        For Example:
            80% = 80/100
            If we divide them by 20 = 80/100 / 20,20 = 4/5.
            80% = 4/5
        Another example:
            50% = 50/100
            If we divide them by 50 = 50/100 / 50,50 = 1/2.
            50% = 1/2
        
        We must be able to convert between percentages, fractions, decimals.
