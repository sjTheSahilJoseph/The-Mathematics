    /* Maths is Everywhere.

    Mathematical truths existed before we created symbols to describe them.

    Maths is truth, it doesn't need our confirmation. To give a equation a
    symbol or a name. It simply exists.

    It'll be true long after they all die.

    Where did the Maths came from?
    Math comes from us.
    We make it.
    And this doesn't strictly refer to the past.

    How do we create Math?
    To answer this, we need to know what math really is.

    What is Mathematics?
    Mathematics is the study of questions that have definite answers.

    Every Mathematical Question have inarguable answer.

    The thing is question is the key, for answering question we create tools.

    We do not decide the answers. We simply observe them.
