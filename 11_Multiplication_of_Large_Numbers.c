        Multiplication of Large Numbers

        n = 10;
        m = 11;
        // We have to multiply it.
            we can put 14 on top of 11 and then we can start multiplying all the digits on top with bottom right.
                4x1 = 4 and then 
                1x1 = 1 but this time, it'll represetn as 10.
                so we get 14
                Now we multiply on top with the next bottom, from right to left.
                    Now we place 0 on bottom of right digit.
                    So we can write nubmer as tens.
                    4x1 = 4 so we get 40. Because this is tens.
                    1x1 = 1 but this is 10x10 = we got 140.
                    14+140
                    = 154
        // We can also use distributive property.
            
            14x11
                Convert that into more round and easy to read stuff.
            14(10+1)
            Now isntead of having 14 times 11, we have 14 times 10.
            14x10 + 14x1
             140  +  14
             = 154


            425 x 12
            425 (10 + 2)
            425 x 10 = 4250
            now 425 x 2 = 850
                4250 + 850
                = 5100

                Basically first multiply with nx(this, and then that)
                After + them.
